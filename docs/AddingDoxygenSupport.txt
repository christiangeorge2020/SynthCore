1. add a /docs folder to your project folder, in parallel with the others (PluginObjects, etc...) - you can name it whatever you like, but it will become part of the repository and public.

Add the doxy.zip stuff to this folder. There will be the following files:

- this text file
- doxyfile
- mainpage.txt
- oscillator.txt
- documentation.html (this is the final link you will leave for the user)

html folder with 3 image files in it. You will replace these ASAP.

2. Add this chunk of code to any of the files; we will use the synthdefs.h file, but you could use any of the source code.
